How to improve privacy on the Internet. Essay for Computer Network course at EPFL.

Subject
=======

How would you design or change the Internet architecture to make user privacy one of the main goals? 
You have two options:

    Propose a completely new (often called "clean-slate") architecture.
    Propose changes to the existing architecture. 

You can define "user privacy" as you wish, as long as you define it clearly. For example, you can focus on "sender anonymity:" when Alice sends a message (e.g., a search request) to Google, neither Google nor any router that forwards Alice's message should know that it is Alice who is sending it. 

The most successful privacy solution offered today is Tor. Please do not propose exactly the same solution. Instead, you could think of a completely new Internet architecture that provides the same properties as Tor (i.e., how should Internet end-hosts and switches operate such that we do not need Tor). Alternatively, you could identify a weakness in Tor and propose a fix. 

There are no strict requirements regarding the structure of the essay. You can either for a short idea paper (kind of like this) or for a more complete architecture description (kind of like this). Needless to say, we do not expect you to produce a complete or error-free solution. Just try to put forward your own ideas, not an existing solution.
